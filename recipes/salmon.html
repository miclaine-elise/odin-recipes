    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cooking a lemon and dill seasoned whole salmon fillet on a smoldering cedar plank adds a touch of smoke to a
        beautiful fish!

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole filet of salmon, skin on, scored (up to but not through the skin) into serving pieces</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced fresh dill</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest, plus lemon wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak an untreated cedar plank (or planks) large enough to hold a side of salmon (5 to 7 inches wide and 16
            to 20 inches long) in water, weighting it with something heavy, like a brick, so it stays submerged 30
            minutes to 24 hours.
        </li>
        <li>When ready to grill, either build a charcoal fire in half the grill or turn grill burners on high for 10
            minutes. Meanwhile, mix oil, garlic, dill, salt, pepper and lemon zest; rub over salmon and into scored
            areas to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Place soaked cedar on hot grill grate, close lid, and watch until wood starts to smoke, about 5 minutes.
            Transfer salmon to hot plank, move salmon off direct charcoal heat or turn burners to low, and cook covered
            until salmon is just opaque throughout (130 on a meat thermometer inserted in the thickest section) 20 to 25
            minutes or longer, depending on thickness and grill temperature. Let sit 5 minutes; serve with lemon wedges.
        </li>
    </ol>
